    "##### Moreover, the confusion matrix shows the model can identify most subscribers successfully. However, it has difficulties to accurately classifying non-subscribers due to class imbalance. Furthermore, the ROC curve does not exhibit a high area under the curve, only slightly above the random chance line. This further shows that its ability to distinguish between the two classes is limited.\n",

Before the analysis, it was reasonable to hypothesize that players with longer playtime or higher experience levels would be more likely to subscribe to the newsletter. The actual results support this hypothesis: subscribers generally have longer playtime, and the subscription rate is slightly higher in the more experienced group. \n",

Although the model has limited predictive power, it still indicates that players with higher engagement or more experience are slightly more likely to subscribe. This suggests recruitment should focus on players who have shown sustained activity or longer playtime."

    "##### These findings provide direction for improving future model development. The model in this study did not perform optimally. There are several limitations that may have impacted model accuracy. \n",
    "##### First, the dataset exhibits imbalance. The number of players subscribing to newsletters far exceeds those who do not. This imbalance makes it difficult for the model to learn effective patterns related to the minority class, leading to incorrect classification of non-subscribers. Second, there is a limited amount of available training data. Due to the small player base and small behavioral variables, the model lacks sufficient information to distinguish between the two groups. Third, the existing variables are insufficient, and some external factors likely influence players' subscription choices. These missing factors may significantly impact subscription decisions.\n",
